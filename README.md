# Employee_Promotion_prediction
This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts whether an employee is likely to be promoted, based on a variety of features such as department, education, previous year ratings, length of service, and more.

# 🧠 Objective
The primary goal is to assist HR departments in identifying employees with high promotion potential using data-driven techniques. This can help improve workforce planning and reduce biases in the promotion process.

# 📁 Project Structure
Promotion_prediction.ipynb: The main notebook that includes data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and final predictions.

README.md: Project overview and documentation (you are reading it!).

# 📊 Dataset
The dataset includes employee-level data with features like:
Department,
Education,
Previous year rating,
Length of service,
KPIs met,
Awards won,
Average training score,
And more...
Target variable: is_promoted (1 = promoted, 0 = not promoted)

# 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The notebook contains visual and statistical analysis to uncover patterns and relationships among features, such as:
Distribution of target classes
Correlation heatmaps
Histograms,countplots and boxplots
Missing value treatment

# 🛠️ Preprocessing
Key steps include:
Handling missing values
Encoding categorical variables
Feature scaling
Train-test split

# 🤖 Model Building
The notebook uses machine learning algorithms such as:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
XGBoost
It also includes:
Resampling methods,
Cross-validation
Performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score)

# 📈 Results
The best-performing model is selected based on cross-validated metrics and is used to predict promotion likelihood on test data.
